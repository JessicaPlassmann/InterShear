# InterShear
Open-source simulation framework for generating shearographic phase maps from FEM data.

## Features
- Import of FEM displacement data for various mechanical loading states
- Planned support for cumulative evaluation of multiple load steps
- Coordinate transformations and extraction of arbitrary subregions
- Visualization of displacement gradients in both x and y directions
- Support for out-of-plane (OOP) shearographic and holographic simulation
- In-plane (IP) deformation simulation planned for future release

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2022b or newer recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox (optional, for visualization)
